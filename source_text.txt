Make no mistake, this one's dangerous.
Are you a Canix fan? You deserve a banner!
Hey, gotta start somewhere right?
Like a Ninja, ready to make a move.
Check out that awesome spikey hairdo!
Can't get enough of Felidax? This banner's for you!
Be careful, no one messes with Lyxx.
No use hiding, Squillax sees it all.
Keep an eye on the target.
Impress your friends with this cool scifi design!
Is it the number eight or two hexagons? No one knows.
Impress with the Hex
A classy design, fit for all the pro duelers out there.
You got your hands on the big guns, huh?
Death never looked so adorable.
Time to rip into the competition.
The pattern for the ponytail ninja.
The pattern for the valiant knight.
A love hate relationship.
Blue sky, green sea.
Make a wish.
Many horns make light work.
Time to make some snow angels.

Basic metal podium.
Channel that warrior spirit with this Sumo inspired look.
Feel like a pro with this shiny and polished Podium.
Win the game with the new anti-slip technology!
For the hardcore Lyxx fans out there.
Blaston All-Star!
A menacing look to intimidate your foes.
Cutting edge technology.
Display your mechanized devotion.

Better think twice, Felidax is here to win!
Canix is a gladiator with a heart of gold and the mohawk to back it up.
Many duelers have fallen before the menace that is Lyxx.
Keep your eyes peeled or Cetox will make you regret it.
Dracx loves to blow enemies into smithereens. Watch out or you will be next!
Aranex has been wandering the world, in search for the next challenge.
Brace yourself, Squillax is joining the fray.
Look at those horns! Taurex means business.
With an aura of awesomeness and some nasty looking tusks, Scrofax has arrived!
Stay frosty or Krysox might bust you to bits!
We can see Hax has entered the arena with an ulterior motive. Will you join the cause?
You've got latency (high ping) which will impair your dueling.
Your network ping is high. You are not allowed to enter a Tournament until you improve your latency.

A rapid-fire, high-ammo weapon, good for keeping your opponent busy.
Fires a veritable wall of low-damage, hard-to-dodge bullets. Great for taking down defenses.
A powerful and accurate weapon. Low ammo and rate of fire, so better make each shot count!
Launches a large, slow-moving and devastating Orb. Excellent for forcing your opponent to reposition or to use defensively.
Generates a steady, damage over time Ion Beam which you can use to box in your opponent.
A shield that will block incoming bullets and Ion Beams, but it won't last forever.
Generates a Defmesh. Use this to block Bullets and Ion Beams, but take care of the collision points!
A high skill grenade which can wreak havoc if timed right. Pull the trigger to start the countdown!
This Viper variant can curve the bullets around defenses. The curve is determined by your arm rotation before the trigger pull.
This Hammer variant can curve the bullets around defenses. The curve is determined by your arm rotation before the trigger pull.
This variant of the Lance couples high ammo with a faster rate of fire.
This grenade generates multiple Beam Cage explosions. Pull the trigger to start the countdown!
This grenade generates an Ion Beam aiming towards the opponent. Pull the trigger to start the countdown!
A grenade that explodes into a static Beam Cage. Great for blocking access to weapons or movement!
A quick-spawning weapon that ensures you'll always have something to shoot! Can be used defensively, try shooting down bullets!
Lobs a massive Beam Cage which can be great for forcing your opponent to reposition.
This shield has a fast respawn rate but low durability. The perfect quick counter to Bullets, Beams and Orbs.
Launches a large and slow moving Beam Cage, your opponent will want to avoid this one!
This Raptor variant can curve the bullets around defenses. The curve is determined by your arm rotation before the trigger pull
An easy-to-use grenade which generates a targeted Orb, guaranteed to make your opponent feel uneasy. Pull the trigger to start the countdown!
A launcher which lobs multiple Orbs at your opponent. Devastating when used with skill!
A launcher which lobs multiple bullets at your opponent. Terror from above!
Hold onto the Quicksilver to speed up your shots. Keep it in hand until its gone otherwise you'll take a hit.
Damaging is secondary, with a skilfully placed toss to obscure the vision of your opponent you could change the outcome of every round.
Obscure the vision of your opponent, or skillfully defend with this extremely fast weapon. Set up combos you could only ever dream of.
Very fragile spinning Orbs: almost any Collision will destroy them. But their devious motion will take the opponent's attention, use that!
Bullets bounce on surfaces. The trick is now to remember that other guns don't.

Crushing the opponents doesn't have to be all doom & gloom. Here's something to cheer them up.
Still feeling that holiday vibe? Spread the joy. And Bullets.
There's nothing humble about being #1. Smoke 'em.
Blast your way into the future, this pack is not just a fad.
Your opponent won't have a clew what hit them!

The direction you look orients your body so watch those bullets pass by.. or under you!
Turning side on is key to dodging Viper bullets and Orbs.
Orbs survive colliding each other but then they are left with a small amount of HP: throw an empty gun to destroy them.
Rather than using weapons as they spawn, why not wait for a combo?
Shoot through your own Defenses and Orbs to surprise your Opponent.
Collision is Damage to Projectiles. In Blaston all Bullets have Collision and HP.
Throw your activated Shield to clear out Bullets before they enter your space.
When the spawned weapons reach capacity, the current weapon pauses spawning and blinks red.
Toss your empty weapons at Bullets to destroy them.
Care about your position on the Podium, aggressive at the front, defensive at the back.
Remember in dodging that your sides are much thinner than your front.
Dash through Ion Beams to escape a trap: better to lose some HP than lose the Round.
When it's down to 1HP, finish off your opponent with a quick weapon toss!
Opponents may have guns you haven’t unlocked yet. Don’t worry, there's no power order, they're not more powerful, just different.
Bait grenades' auto-aim by going to your Podium's edge then quickly recenter after explosion. Safe!
Bots difficulty increases with your league points all the way to Overlord.
