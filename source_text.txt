Make no mistake, this one's dangerous.
Are you a Canix fan? You deserve a banner!
Hey, gotta start somewhere right?
Like a Ninja, ready to make a move.
Check out that awesome spikey hairdo!
Can't get enough of Felidax? This banner's for you!
Be careful, no one messes with Lyxx.
No use hiding, Squillax sees it all.
Keep an eye on the target.
Impress your friends with this cool scifi design!
Is it the number eight or two hexagons? No one knows.
Impress with the Hex
A classy design, fit for all the pro duelers out there.
You got your hands on the big guns, huh?
Death never looked so adorable.
Time to rip into the competition.
The pattern for the ponytail ninja.
The pattern for the valiant knight
A love hate relationship.
Blue sky, green sea.
Make a wish.
Many horns make light work.
Time to make some snow angels.

Better think twice, Felidax is here to win!
Canix is a gladiator with a heart of gold and the mohawk to back it up.
Many duelers have fallen before the menace that is Lyxx.
Keep your eyes peeled or Cetox will make you regret it.
Dracx loves to blow enemies into smithereens. Watch out or you will be next!
Aranex has been wandering the world, in search for the next challenge.
Brace yourself, Squillax is joining the fray.
Look at those horns! Taurex means business.
With an aura of awesomeness and some nasty looking tusks, Scrofax has arrived!
Stay frosty or Krysox might bust you to bits!
"We are simply an evolution, but are we the last?" We can see Hax has entered the arena with an ulterior motive. Will you join the cause?

The direction you look orients your body so watch those bullets pass by.. or under you!
Turning side on is key to dodging Viper bullets and Orbs.
Orbs survive colliding each other but then they are left with a small amount of HP: throw an empty gun to destroy them.
Rather than using weapons as they spawn, why not wait for a combo?
Shoot through your own Defenses and Orbs to surprise your Opponent.
Collision is Damage to Projectiles. In Blaston all Bullets have Collision and HP.
Throw your activated Shield to clear out Bullets before they enter your space.
When the spawned weapons reach capacity, the current weapon pauses spawning and blinks red.
Toss your empty weapons at Bullets to destroy them.
Care about your position on the Podium, aggressive at the front, defensive at the back.
Remember in dodging that your sides are much thinner than your front.
Dash through Ion Beams to escape a trap: better to lose some HP than lose the Round.
When it's down to 1HP, finish off your opponent with a quick weapon toss!
Opponents may have guns you haven’t unlocked yet. Don’t worry, there's no power order, they're not more powerful, just different.
Bait grenades' auto-aim by going to your Podium's edge then quickly recenter after explosion. Safe!
Bots difficulty increases with your league points all the way to Overlord.
